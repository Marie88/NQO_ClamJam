# 🐚 ClamJam: From Coastal Treasure to Global Brand

## 🌊 Origin Story

ClamJam began as a small, family-run business in a remote coastal village renowned for its crystal-clear waters and a rare species of clam known as **“Silver Shells.”** These clams are celebrated for their exceptional flavor, texture, and nutritional value. For generations, the local community harvested them sustainably, preserving both tradition and the delicate marine ecosystem.

Driven by passion and pride in their unique product, the founders of ClamJam decided to share Silver Shells with the world—transforming a local delicacy into a global experience.
